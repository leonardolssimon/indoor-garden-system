The system includes an automatic on/off function for a lamp, as well as an automatic on/off function for a water pump, which can also be controlled by an interruption button. There is a button for manual interruption and two buttons for adjusting the desired minimum soil moisture. Additionally, it incorporates an RTC module for time control and an OLED display to show the time, temperature, air humidity, soil moisture, and the desired minimum soil moisture.
